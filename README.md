PYTHON GUT TO GENERATE RANDOM OTP, SEND IT TO USER-INPUT EMAIL-ID USING smtplib &amp; email MODULES &amp; VALIDATE THE OTP

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending e-mail and routing e-mail between mail servers. The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.

The email module is a library for managing email messages. It is specifically not designed to do any sending of email messages to SMTP, NNTP, or other servers; those are functions of modules such as smtplib and nntplib. The package attempts to be as RFC-compliant as possible.
